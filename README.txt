A fast paced platformer where you play as a bomb that doesnt want to blow up!

How to play:
Download and run defused.exe from the executables folder, or download the game from itch.io (https://keshavach.itch.io/defused)

My first exploration into real game development with a platformer made in the godot engine. Check out my thoughts at https://keshavach.wixsite.com/portfolio/defused
